## Star Projects/Highlights

#### Python
[A re write of one of my old projects. A very simple but scaleable discord bot that can show server info, moderate users, store specific per server settings and much more. This re write shows much cleaner and optimized code which can easily be read by anyone.](https://github.com/The-Glit-ch/Max)

[A simple project that can take an image file or a custom data file and draw it on screen. It uses OpenCV to find lines on a image and then sends that data to the program for it to be drawn.](https://github.com/The-Glit-ch/Free-Draw-Bot) || Demos: [Demo 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJzhtRGQvMY) [Demo 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRYzwfDA4sM)

#### Godot X Python

[A very interesting mini project that allows to turn your phone(Android only) into a drawing tablet. Two seperate binaries are needed. The APK file which turns your phone into a client and the python file which turns your computer into a listen server. Data is sent via websockets from your phone to your pc](https://github.com/The-Glit-ch/MobileTab)
