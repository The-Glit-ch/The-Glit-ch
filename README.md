## About me
I am a 14 year old self taught programmer. I have done a mix of Node.js, Python, C++ and Lua programming. I have also used the Unreal Engine 4, Godot, and Roblox platforms/engines

### Stuff I'm proud of

### Python

[Wow a discord bot that has a custom commission system where people can make/edit commissions and other people can accept/cancel those commissions along with a rating system and custom profile?!. No way!!](https://github.com/The-Glit-ch/Artist-Unite-Bot)

[A cool thing I made in python that draws an image from an image or a custom data file. (Trust me its fun to use especially in drawing games)](https://github.com/The-Glit-ch/Free-Draw-Bot)
